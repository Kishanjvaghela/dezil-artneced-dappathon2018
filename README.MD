## Dezil-artneced tender system

### Problem Statement
1. Government procurement involves a high risk of corruption because of the great size of financial turnover and the complexitiy of many procurement processes in which businesses interact very closely with politicians and civil servants.

2. Talented small scale business are never considered since the decision maker is centralized

3. Though tender system is made online and pubic data can be tampered and faked via back doors.

4. Its is public and transparent but not trustworthy.

Any improvement to the current system will benefit a very large population.With 10 to 20% of GDP, government procurement accounts for a substantial part of the global economy.

### Our Solution
We are proposing to build a decentralized tender system where the government can create tender which is public and immutable. Bidders can pitch in for the project. Here unlike a centralized server the blockchain itself with decide the winner of the bid and announces to the public. The flow of the construction work can also be tracked in the system.

Ensures equality for all.Even the admin or the creator cannot tamper the data.Transparency in the system is easily slowly kills corruption.

### Is Blockchain really necessary here ?
1. Without blockchain data is mutable and fake
2. Need for centralized organisational leadership. Auto governance system by solidity smart contract
3. All transactions are open and transparent

## Application Flow


### Architechture Modules
##### Validation
Bidders in the network call create protfolio to add a new person to the network, once they've validated thier identity is stored in IPFS

##### Admin
Admin can create a tender details and close tender.

#### Bidders
Bidders can pitch for tender and submit thier bid. They can update the status of the tender they are working on

#### Smart contract
Based on specific parameters smart contracts will decide the bid winner and announce in public.
The contract is assigned to that contractor and status of the project is tracked.

### Tech Stack
```
Ethereum smart constracts (in solidity)
Ganache testnet
Truffle framework
Remix IDE (to test smart contracts)
Web3.js
Firebase to store user credentials
ReactJS
```

#### Steps to compile in Truffle
```
truffle compile
truffle console
Interact using Web3.js
npm run start
```
##Inadequacy in the System
1. Selection algorithm for the winner is not perfect.
2. Initial adoption of the system might be slow.

## Impact to Society:
1. Transparency adopted in one government project will eventually be implemented all sectors like healthcare and eduction systems.
2. Obtain real democracy
3. A corruption free world can be created in every small adoption
4. Decentralized systems will be built by us, for us to improve the quality of living
